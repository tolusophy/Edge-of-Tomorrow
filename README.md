# Edge-of-Tomorrow
[Paper]

## Overview
This repository contains the research data for our study on the performance of Large Language Models (LLM)-backed chatbots—namely ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat—in addressing True/False questions within the domains of Climate Change and Mental Health. The study investigates the performance of Large Language Model (LLM)-backed chatbots—namely ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat—in addressing True/False questions and providing information within the domains of Climate Change and Mental Health. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, we assess the chatbots' ability to discern the veracity of statements, their adherence to facts based on similarity index scores, and the presence of bias or misinformation in their responses. Our quantitative analysis reveals that while ChatGPT shows high accuracy in identifying true statements, the performance varies across domains, with a notably better outcome in the Mental Health domain. The qualitative insights, gathered from domain experts, underline the potential utility of chatbots in raising awareness and providing information, yet they raise concerns regarding privacy, ethical implications, and the necessity for chatbots to direct users to professional services. The study concludes that while LLM-backed chatbots hold significant promise, their deployment in sensitive areas necessitates careful consideration, ethical oversight, and rigorous refinement to ensure they serve as a beneficial augmentation to human expertise rather than an autonomous solution.
